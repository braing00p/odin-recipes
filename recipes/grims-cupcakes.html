        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Miasma Flour (store-bought or freshly harvested from ancient crypts)</li>
            <li>1Â½ cups Soul Sugar (ethically sourced from willing spirits)</li>
            <li>3 Phantom Eggs (laid by spectral chickens at midnight)</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Reaper's Tears (collected during sad movies)</li>
            <li>1 cup Haunted Heavy Cream (from ghost cows, obviously)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Graveyard Dust (for that earthy finish)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Essence of Night</li>
            <li>A pinch of Banshee's Breath (for extra fluffiness)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Frosting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Shadowspun Butter</li>
            <li>3 cups Powdered Spirit Sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract (from the rarest orchids)</li>
            <li>1 tsp Moonlight Extract</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Void Chocolate (72% dark, obviously)</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- instructions -->
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your cauldron to 180Â°C (or the temperature of a lukewarm spirit).</li>
            <li>In a cursed mixing bowl, sift together the Miasma Flour and Graveyard Dust. Set aside while whispering gentle incantations.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, cream together Soul Sugar and Shadowspun Butter until the mixture is as pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li>Add Phantom Eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. <em>Don't worry if you hear faint clucking sounds - that's normal.</em></li>
            <li>Slowly fold in your flour mixture, alternating with Haunted Heavy Cream. The batter should be smooth as a freshly polished tombstone.</li>
            <li>Fill cupcake liners (preferably purple) about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a bone pick inserted comes out clean.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>For the Frosting:</h2>
        <p class="tip">Beat all frosting ingredients until light and fluffy as morning mist. Pipe onto cooled cupcakes using a #666 tip.</p>
